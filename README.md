To install software on your computer and run on localhost:
  1. Make sure that you have the latest version of Python installed, use the Python docs to install.
  2. Clone the Git repository to your computer.
  3. Open the folder in a terminal and run the script file install.sh, this will create a virtual environment and install all the requirements.
  4. Run the run.sh file
  5. Go to localhost:8000 and use the software!

If you are using Windows, run the .bat files instead in Steps 3 & 4.
Remember: These are just development instructions and should NOT be used for hosting or production purposes as this uses Djangoâ€™s developmental server.
